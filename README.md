Documents related to PLDI 2016.

The document formatting instructions given here echo those prescribed
by the August 2015 version of the [Practices of the PLDI](http://www.sigplan.org/sites/default/files/PracticesofPLDI.201508.pdf) document.

> Papers should follow the standard two-column ACM proceedings style in 10-point font and be at most 11 pages, exclusive of the bibliography. The bibliography is excluded from the page count to encourage good citation practices and discourage illegible bibliographies. Citations can be either in numeric style or author-year style. Numeric citations always stand as a parenthetical note (e.g., “[42]”), while author-year citations may stand either as a noun phrase (e.g., “Church (1935)”), or as a parenthetical note (e.g., “(Church, 1935)”).

To format your document for submission (the above format, double-blind, numeric citations), use _pldi_ as your option. For author-year, use _pldiauthoryear_.
